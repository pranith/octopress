My proposal to work on memory consistency issues in the multi-threaded TCG
project got accepted as part of Google Summer Of Code 2016! For those of you
interested in the details, at a very high level, I am going to work on
enabling execution of mis-matched memory model guest architectures on a
different host architecture. The easiest way to achieve this is to generate
memory fence instructions on every memory access, but this has a drastic
overhead on performance since fence instructions can have significant
latency. The plan is to generate fence instructions appropriately to ensure
the consistency model expected by the guest while keeping the performance
overhead to a minimum.

I am looking forward to working with my mentor Alex Benn√©e and get the patches
accepted upstream by the end of summer. I will use this blog to keep track of
my progress and as a sounding board for the work I will be doing.
