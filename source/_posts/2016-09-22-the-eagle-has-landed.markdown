I've been working on adding support to ensure
[memory consistency](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4952417305100288)
in qemu over the summer. This work initially was done as part of Google
Summer of Code ([GSoC](http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)), and I plan to
continue the work in my spare time.

GSoC is a learning experience which introduces students to open source
communities. Students are supposed to learn how to contribute and get involved
in the development community. The ideal outcome of the GSoC program is to see
your work included in the upstream codebase. More often than not, the code by
the student does not make it upstream. It lives somewhere in an experimental
branch.

Given this likely scenario, I am really excited to know that my code
contribution has made it
[upstream](https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg397935.html)!
The [MTTCG](http://wiki.qemu.org/Features/tcg-multithread) project in qemu
seems to be in the final stages with almost all patches ready to be included
except for some minor nits. I can't wait for it all to land in the master
branch.
